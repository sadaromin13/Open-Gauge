# Open-Gauge
  Hi, welcome to my first github project and also my first open source project. The goal is to design, build and code an Arduino based gauge system. 
I find most after market gauge systems do a lot of price gouging. They over charge for intially for parts and have high failure rates. These high 
failure rates end up making the consumer buy marked up replacments from a first party. I personally have had to much experince with these parts failing
because of this I decided to take matters into my own hands and with the help of chat gpt write my first complex code. I have minimal coding experince
but with my limited experince and ChatGPT I believe I can make a base eco system that is easily expandable.
